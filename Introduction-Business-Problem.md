<h1>New City Neighborhood Project </h1>

Most of us have to move around to different cities for various reasons like new college, job, trainings, vacations etc. But we would wish to reside in a neighborhood where we get the facilities that are important for us.

The goal of the project is to predict and suggest the best possible neighborhoods for the user based on their priorities. The unsupervised learning method KMeans Clustering is used to learn from FourSquare location data to cluster neighborhoods based on the extent of common facilities available. I have chosen the location to be Bangalore for this project.

This is a great feature to incorporate for online travel and hotel agencies so that they can guide their users better in choosing where to stay in the new city.
